  <li><strong>Handle adding tasks:</strong> Implement functionality to add a new task by updating the state and rendering the updated task list.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Handle displaying tasks:</strong> Render the list of tasks on the page using JSX and map through the state to dynamically generate each task component.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Implement task updates:</strong> Add the ability to edit a task by capturing the task's new value and updating the state accordingly.</li>
